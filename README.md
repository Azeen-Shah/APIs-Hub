TEAM API HUB
============

<b>Not always the turtle wins, nor always the slower succeed!</b> 

After a very speedy learning, it was expected from students of Bano Qabil 2.0 that they can design an interactive website after learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After the worth learning with <b>Sir Adil Ahmed Sheihani</b>, it appeared to be possible for us to meet the expectations. Starting from scratch, we were taught to build a basic structure with HTML.
CSS was learnt for it's decoration, and finally our respected teacher turned us towards JavaScript. JavaScript is a true love, if you are coding with heart.

The foundation of our Group <b>API HUB</b> was laid, once our teacher taught us JSON and APIs. Since then, we are continously engaged in interaction with APIs. We started communicating with different servers, fetched data and displayed on our webpages. We are dealing with APIs.

For show-casing our efforts and expertise level with JSON and API, we have designed the subject website.
